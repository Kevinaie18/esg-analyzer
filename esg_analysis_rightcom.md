1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

RightCom presents significant opportunities for impact and ESG-focused investments, with potential areas of focus in gender inclusion (2X-001) and robust environmental and social management systems (IFC-PS1-005). The company's main services, particularly the RightCom XP software, could potentially drive positive impacts in customer experience management, especially if implemented with a gender lens. However, due diligence should focus on the company's current ESG integration practices (INT-001), with potential risks stemming from lack of disclosure on environmental impacts and corporate governance.

2. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

Given the information provided, RightCom's environmental risks may be relatively low due to its position in the service sector. However, the company should conduct an assessment to identify potential climate impact from its operations, including energy use and waste generation from its offices and call centers. Best practices in environmental management should be implemented, including energy efficiency measures and waste reduction strategies.

3. SOCIAL ANALYSIS

RightCom's social impact potential could be significant, particularly in the area of job creation and skill development. However, due diligence should focus on labor and community relations, including employee working conditions, wages, and benefits. The company should also consider implementing a gender lens in its recruitment and training practices, in line with the 2X criteria.

4. GOVERNANCE ANALYSIS

Governance risks may arise from lack of transparency and accountability in corporate decision-making. The company should ensure that it has robust corporate structures and controls in place, including clear roles and responsibilities, a code of conduct, and mechanisms for addressing complaints and grievances. Compliance with relevant laws and regulations should also be assessed, including data protection and privacy laws due to the company's use of customer data.

5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT

RightCom's services align with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure). Potential impact metrics could include the number of jobs created, customer satisfaction rates, and reductions in energy use and waste. Impact risks could stem from negative impacts on employee wellbeing and privacy concerns related to customer data.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS

Due diligence should prioritize assessing the company's current ESG integration practices, environmental management practices, and gender inclusion policies. ESG clauses in the shareholder agreement could require the company to implement a gender lens in recruitment and training, adopt energy efficiency measures, and establish a robust environmental and social management system. Key performance indicators could include gender parity in the workforce, customer satisfaction rates, and reductions in energy use and waste.
