# Basic 2X ESG

Basic 2X ESG refers to the basic assessment of an investee's fundamental environmental and social (E&S) standards that is required for 2X alignment. Particular attention is paid to their safeguarding measures against gender-based violence and harassment (GBVH). The investee's ESG performance should be a factor when assessing 2X alignment to confirm that the investee is not contributing to negative impacts on women.

Environmental & social risk management (E&S) according to international standards as well as Business Integrity checks represent the foundational starting point. Particular attention must be paid to gender risks, including gender-based violence and harassment (GBVH) in advance of qualifying any investment under the 2X Criteria.

In practice this means that in advance of any investor/FI qualifying an investment as 2X aligned, it is considered a pre-requisite to ensure the following:
a) activities under the Harmonised EDFI Exclusion List and Harmonised EDFI Fossil Fuel Exclusion List are not financed,
b) investee demonstrates commitment to respecting human rights, and
c) investee has adequate safeguarding systems to be in place.

When significant gaps or chronic underperformance in 2X ESG areas are identified, Investor/FI should exercise judgment on alignment based on severity of the risk and the investee's commitment to change. In exceptional cases, where the investee does not meet this requirement yet, the investor can agree on a formal time-bound action plan to introduce / refine such systems having been incorporated into the ESAP and actioned within 6 months of close.

## Exclusion list adherence

Investee commitment to comply / due diligence to confirm that the investee is not involved or investing in any of the List of Excluded Activities, and including restrictions on the use of proceeds by financial intermediaries for on-lending to only entities that are not involved in any of the following:
a) Forced labour
b) Child labour
c) Pornography and/or prostitution
d) Racist and/or anti-democratic media
e) Any of the following product(s) form a substantial part of your business / financed activities: alcoholic beverages (except beer or wine); tobacco; weapons and munitions; gambling, casinos and equivalent enterprises
f) Activities or materials deemed illegal
g) Cross-border trade in waste and waste products
h) Destruction of High Conservation Value areas
i) Radioactive materials and unbounded asbestos fibres
j) Fossil fuels as defined by the harmonised EDFI Fossil Fuel Exclusion List

If it turns out that evidence of being involved in or financing excluded activities based on the Exclusion List is revealed at any point in the future, the investee will no longer be 2X aligned until they address/remedy the situation.

## Commitment to respecting human rights

The investee must meet the four key elements below to demonstrate their commitment to respecting human rights. These are accompanied by examples an investee can do:

1. Demonstrated commitment to ILO core labour standards
   a) Policies/practices in place that support and respect workers' freedom of association and their right to join or form trade unions
   b) Compliance with local labour laws and regulations related to forced labour
   c) Policy or commitment that explicitly prohibits the employment of children under the age of 18 and/or below the minimum age as defined by national laws
   d) Mechanisms to monitor, address and mitigate the risk of any potential instances of child labour, including hazardous work, in supply chain or business operations
   e) Policies/practices that promote equity, diversity and inclusion and/or prohibits discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or otherwise
   f) Documented health and safety (OHS) procedures and policies in place

2. Demonstrated commitment to leading human rights guidelines or standards (For Funds, FIs, & Institutional investors, this includes for clients/investees and the institution itself)
   a) UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (GPs)
   b) OECD guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct
   c) IFC Performance Standards
   d) (For Funds, FIs, institutional investors) UN PRI signature

3. ESG policy and procedures in place that:
   a) (For Funds, FIs, Institutional Investors) Requires ESG policies, procedures and risk categorisation of clients/investees into High, Medium and Low risk according to sector, size and regional classification
   b) (For Companies) Address key environmental and social risks relevant for your type of company considering sector, size, geography, and other factors that impact gender-related risks

4. Person(s) specifically responsible for ESG and/or human rights topics.

The investor should agree with the investee on a measurable, time-bound target to meeting this requirement within 2 years (to be embedded in an ESAP or other internal action plan or governance document). The ESAP should include safeguarding.

## Basic Gender-based Violence and Harassment (GBVH) safeguarding measures

A company, fund or FI is required to demonstrate at least 1 basic GBVH safeguarding requirement.
This reinforces their commitment to respecting the right to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including GBVH, as noted in the ILO Convention on Violence and Harassment in the World of Work (C-190).

Funds must also require at least 1 basic GBVH safeguarding requirement from their portfolio companies, alongside meeting this at the Fund Manager level.

FIs do not need to screen all individual borrowers [or clients/customers] for gender risks. Rather, the expectation is that the FIs' ESMS incorporates a gender lens to enable the FI to assess gender-differentiated risks in its portfolio, or that the FI is committing to adopt a gender lens in their ESMS within a reasonable timeframe.

This can be demonstrated through any of the following examples, among others:
- Zero tolerance policy (applicable internally and externally, e.g., suppliers, service providers)
- No forced arbitration requirement/clause re: GBVH claims
- Gender-responsive grievance mechanism for GBVH claims (e.g., safe & confidential)
- Gender-responsive remediation process for GBVH issues (e.g., clear, survivor-centered investigation procedures)
- Risk management process(es) consider(s) GBVH a salient/material risk
- Code of Conduct that prohibits all forms of GBVH
- Mandatory training of all staff on GBVH and company policies/procedures
- Regular monitoring processes
- Dedicated, trained staff to identify and manage GBVH issues
- Safe environment for all work-related activities including physical work environment and transport

In cases where an investee has strong policies and practices regarding "sexual harassment" safeguarding, but no explicit mention of "gender-based" harassment, it is acceptable and it will be considered to meet this component.

# Governance & Accountability

Intentionality has always been a key principle of the 2X Criteria and is now codified as Governance & Accountability (G&A).

## Companies and Financial Institutions (FIs)

Minimum Governance & Accountability requirements for COMPANIES and FIs be 2X aligned include at least:
- One (1) indicator in Strategic action
- One (1) indicator in Management systems
- One (1) gender data requirement

### Strategic action can include:
- Public commitment related to gender equity
- Clear, measurable & time-bound gender targets beyond specific minimum requirements for 2X alignment
- Action items or action plan to drive gender equity (that may be linked to gender targets) with clear roles, responsibilities and timelines

### Management systems can include:
- Core gender policies
- Accountability for gender including regular monitoring / monitoring plan of gender-related efforts and/or progress against gender targets
- Gender-responsive grievance mechanism
- Risk management efforts that explicitly consider gender
- Internal and/or external stakeholder engagement capturing a gender perspective

## Funds

Minimum Governance & Accountability requirements for FUNDS to be 2X aligned include at least:
- One (1) indicator in Strategic action
- One (1) indicator in Management systems
- One (1) gender data requirement

### Strategic action can include:
- Public commitment related to gender equity and/or investing with a gender lens
- Clear, measurable & time-bound gender targets beyond the specific minimum requirements for 2X alignment at the portfolio level or that are agreed with portfolio companies directly
- Action items or action plan to drive gender equity at the Portfolio level that may be linked to gender targets with clear roles/ responsibilities and timelines

### Data
- Regular collection and analysis of gender-/sex-disaggregated data (at least annually) of Portfolio companies

# Entrepreneurship & Ownership

Investees are aligned with the Entrepreneurship & Ownership (E&O) Criteria if women have a majority stake in, or founded, the investee.

## Criteria & Thresholds

| Criteria | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| 1A. Share of women ownership | 51% |
| OR | |
| 1B. Business founded by a woman | 50% |

### Criteria detail
**1A. Share of women ownership - 51% share**
- Percentage of the organisation that is directly or indirectly woman owned
- The Criteria specifies primarily direct ownership but indirect ownership also counts if data is available.

**1B. Business founded by a woman - 50%**
- Investees founded by a woman or a group of women that retain(s) an active role in the organization

### Threshold rationale
**1A. Share of women ownership - 51% share**
- Gender lens investing standards such as WeConnect promote investments in majority women-owned firms
- Women comprise 18% of all business owners in Africa, 21% in Asia, and 24% in Latin America, so opportunities for investment exist

**1B. Business founded by a woman (50% founders)**
- This means that majority (or at least half) of the founders were women and retain an active role.
- This threshold was set at 50% as women should be at least equally represented among founders. As there are typically 1-2 founders or just a small number of founders, the threshold based on number of founders was set at 50% (rather than 51%).

**Formula:** Shares held by women / Total shares x 100

# Leadership

Investees are aligned with the leadership criteria if women are well-represented at senior management or Board/IC level.

## Criteria & Thresholds

| Criteria | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| 2A. Share of women in senior management | Varies |
| OR | |
| 2B. Share of women on the Board or Investment Committee | Varies |

### Criteria detail
**2A. Share of women in senior management**
- Senior management (e.g. C-suite equivalent and senior officers)

**2B. Share of women on the Board (Companies and FIs) or IC (Funds)**
- Share of women on the organisation's board
- Only members with voting rights should be considered
- Investees at which women Board members do not play an active role on the Board should not be counted

### Threshold rationale
The minimum threshold globally is 30%.
The exact threshold is set at the intersection of country and sector: 2X adjusted the minimum thresholds according to the most recent benchmarking data, which reflects the average of country-sector standards. These adjusted thresholds were rounded up to nudge performance slightly above the national benchmark.

Furthermore, the threshold must be above the legal minimum. For example, the threshold for countries in the European Union is 40%.

**Formula:** Women in Senior Management / Total people in Senior Management x 100
**Formula:** Women on the Board/IC / Total people on the Board/IC x 100

# Employment

Investees are aligned with the Employment Criteria if they provide quality jobs to a significant share of women. For Criteria 3 (Employment) to be met, there should be no dissonance with Criteria 2 (Leadership). Both indicators should be evaluated.

## Criteria & Thresholds

| Criteria | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| Share of women in the workforce AND | Varies |
| One "quality" Employment indicator beyond compliance | Yes/No |

### Criteria detail
**Share of women in the workforce**
Investor/FI should count the direct workforce and contracted workers as it makes sense in the investee's context.
A weighted average of relevant groups must be above the threshold, or each relevant group should be individually above the threshold.
- Direct workforce: Share of women directly employed full- and part-time by the investee counted on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis
- Contracted workforce: Share of women among third party workers or contractors engaged to perform work related to core business processes for a substantial duration (e.g. a season in the case of an agribusiness)

**Quality indicator**
Investee should have at least one effort—beyond those required by local law—addressing barriers to women's quality employment, with evidence of implementation. As employee types can vary, the quality indicator must be linked to the most representative employee type(s).

### Threshold rationale
The minimum threshold globally is 25%.
The exact threshold is set at the intersection of country and sector: 2X adjusted the minimum thresholds according to the most recent benchmarking data, which reflects the average of country-sector standards. These adjusted thresholds were rounded up to nudge performance slightly above the national benchmark.

**Formula:** Women Direct Employees (FTE) / Total Direct Employees (FTE) x 100
**Formula:** Women Contracted Employees / Total Contracted Employees x 100

# Supply Chain

Criteria 4 (Supply Chain) aims to address gender broadly in the supply chain context, including: (1) women-owned/-led suppliers, (2) suppliers that explicitly address gender equity and (3) women supply chain workers.

## Criteria & Thresholds

| Criteria | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| Commitment to women in supply chain AND | Yes/No |
| One "quality" Supply Chain indicator beyond compliance | Yes/No |

### Criteria detail
To be aligned with the supply chain criteria, the investee must demonstrate:
a) strategic commitment to women in the supply chain
AND
b) at least one "quality indicator" in the supply chain

### Threshold rationale
Supply chains have traditionally been very opaque and gender-related issues have been pervasive but difficult to tackle given this opacity. Previously under the 2X Criteria, the focus was on supply chain worker gender diversity (under the Employment criteria), but this is generally very difficult to measure reliably. This is why with this update we aim to meet the market where it's at and started by exploring a 'strategic commitment' and quality indicator (instead of a specific quantitative metric).

# Products & Services

This Criteria evaluates if an investee provides products or services that drive gender-specific positive effects linked to enhancing the well-being of women/girls, and/or driving gender equity.

## Criteria & Thresholds

| Criteria | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| Product(s) or service(s) enhance(s) well-being of women/girls and/or drives gender equity | Yes/No |

### Criteria detail
To be aligned with the Criteria 5 (Products & Services), the investee must (at least) offer product(s)/service(s) that drive gender-specific positive effects linked to enhancing the well-being of women/girls and/or drive gender equity.

For each proposed 2X aligned investment, the investee needs to provide a rationale and clear links on how the product(s)/service(s) offered are designed to be gender-responsive and have a direct positive effect on women/girls. Alignment with this criteria can be further supported if the investee also demonstrates additional ways in which their product(s)/service(s) enhance the well-being of women/girls and/or drive gender equity. These can include the examples below (it is important to note that these are insufficient alone):

1. Product(s)/service(s) specifically target women customers
2. Efforts in place to integrate gender-specific considerations across product(s)/service(s) life cycle (e.g., design/development, marketing, advertising, distribution, customer service/feedback)
3. Gender-specific considerations are captured in product(s)/service(s) safety efforts

Given the unique nature of infrastructure transactions, these transactions are subject to specific evidence requirements.

# Portfolio

Investments through financial intermediaries are aligned for 2X indirectly.

## Criteria & Thresholds

| Criteria | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| 6A. Financial Institutions (FIs): Percent of the investor loan proceeds or percent of FI's portfolio supporting businesses that meet the 2X Criteria | 30% |
| OR | |
| 6B. Funds: Percent of portfolio companies that meet the 2X Criteria | 30-50% |

### Criteria detail
**6A. Financial Institutions (FIs)**
- Either the FI commits that min. 30% of the Investor/FI loan proceeds will go towards businesses that are 2X aligned OR the FI's existing portfolio is comprised of at least 30% businesses (by volume or value) that are 2X aligned. The Investor/FI should monitor the use of proceeds to ensure compliance over time.

**6B. Funds**
- The fund must commit that 30% of investees must meet the 2X Criteria (requirements for companies) going into the fund (at origination) OR reach min. 50% at the the end of the fund's life (at exit).
- Exception: Infrastructure funds must meet 30% by the end of the fund's life (at exit)
- Evergreen funds: 50% of existing portfolio investments must meet the 2X Criteria minimum requirements for companies 5 years after first investment of the fund and from then onwards the 50% threshold must be kept stable

### Threshold rationale
**Portfolio – 30% by value OR volume for FIs**
- Women consistently have lower access to finance than men therefore access to investment is beneficial
- For FIs lending to SMEs, the 30% threshold is benchmarked to the share of women-led SMEs which on average is around 30% globally.

**Portfolio – 30% by volume for Funds**
- For funds, the threshold was increased with the latest updates to the 2X Criteria based on the practical experience with the 2X Challenge 2018-2022.
