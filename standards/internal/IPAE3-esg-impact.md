# 3.8 ESG & Impact policy

## 3.8.1 At I&P group level: a unique approach to ESG & impact measurement

I&P aims at maximizing the environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts of its partner companies, both at the company and portfolio levels. Our approach endeavors to foster the emergence of innovative and mutual ESG solutions for African SMEs.

### ESG methodology

I&P has designed a unique method of analysis and monitoring of environmental, social and governance dimensions which places ESG factors at the core of its partner companies' development strategy, considering these factors as powerful performance levers integrated into daily business practices.

I&P's practical ESG tool follows the whole investment process, from the due diligence phase to the exit, with monitoring based on a prioritized action plan and a defined timeframe. This tool is structured to cover IFC's Performance Standards to ensure that the various principles are respected or that mitigation action will be taken if necessary.

In addition to a company-by-company approach, I&P has defined key areas of focus and seeks to implement, whenever possible, portfolio-level tools and approaches. In the social protection sector for example, a program has been set up to help partner companies implement or improve health insurance systems on a case-by-case basis while exploring the development of shared actions at the portfolio level. In the environmental sector, I&P assesses the IPAE 1 portfolio carbon emissions on a yearly basis, to identify the main sources of reduction or offset and implements specific actions to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. This portfolio-level strategy will be continued and deepened in the context of IPAE 2.

I&P's ESG & Impact Reporting is conceived as a comprehensive review of the investment vehicles' societal strategy and is published annually. The document presents the methodology of ESG policy and impact measurement and examines the main results and achievements of partner companies over the year. More details about our IPAE 2 ESG & Impact Measurement Approach are provided later in this document.

### I&P contributions and references in the ESG and impact investing fields

## 3.8.2 Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS)

As a reminder, IPAE3 will not be allowed to invest in projects considered to have high ESG risk. Given the impact thesis of the IPAE funds and the scale of the companies, we have so far not encountered a case of a company being classified as high risk, although some may have been considered medium + risk.

An exclusion list will also be implemented as a continuation of what has been done in previous IPAE funds.

Once assured that the project is not on the exclusion list and is not classified as high risk, then the investment team will use the ESG tool developed by I&P to track ESG issues from screening to exit.

### SCREENING

A first ESG assessment is done on each potential investment. This provides an opportunity to discuss the main potential risks identified during the selection committee and to consider the priority areas to be checked during the due diligence.

#### Climate
➔ Does the company provide solutions for adapting to or mitigating climate change for its clients or suppliers? If not, how can I&P support it in developing such solutions?
➔ Is the company prepared for consequence of climate change on its own activities? Can I&P support it in its adaptation strategies?

#### Gender
➔ 2X Challenge filter
➔ If not, how can I&P support it to fit 2X Challenge criteria?

### DUE DILIGENCE

If the project is open and passes the selection committee, it will then be subject to ESG due diligence. For this, the investment team will complete a checklist based on the IFC performance standards.

- Social considerations including, but not limited to, working conditions and human resources management, occupational health and safety and impact on local communities
- Environmental considerations, such as water and waste management, carbon footprint and energy efficiency, impact on biodiversity, etc.
- Governance-related considerations such as business integrity and corporate governance framework

For all project rated with a medium or high E&S risk, an external audit will be done as a pre-investment assessment. Indeed, IPAE3 seeks to strengthen its ESG practices, notably by reinforcing external ESG due diligence for most projects. In fact, any medium or medium-high risk project will be subject to external due diligence. This practice, which is already widespread in IPAE2 thanks to a partnership with Ibis Consulting, will therefore be systematised for most IPAE3 companies, except for those with a low risk (essentially service companies).

#### Climate
➔ Evaluating climate risk and adaptation to identify areas of concern
➔ Along with an energy efficiency and carbon footprint report

#### Gender
➔ Gender analysis on the company and different stakeholders especially in the upstream value chain or among the beneficiaries of the products and services developed by the company

### MONITORING

Following the ESG Due Diligence, an ESG action plan will be implemented to mitigate the identified risks and take the necessary corrective measures to enable the company to progressively align with the IFC performance standards and international best practice.

ESG standards regarding partner companies' main stakeholders will be strengthened and duly formalized in order to ensure prospective investments' full commitment to IPAE 3's impact project.

#### For employees:
- Full compliance with labor laws will be required following IPAE 3's investment.
- Prospective investees shall promote continuous progress on a decent work agenda as defined by ILO as opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace (formalized by a management plan for projects involving significant risk) and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration, freedom for people to express their concerns, organize and participate in the decisions that affect their lives and equal opportunity and treatment for all women and men.
- With regard to social protection, basic health insurance guarantees (as a minimum) for employees shall be in place or implemented following the investment with IPAE 3's technical assistance support to ensure employees' access to essential health care.
- With regard to gender equality, if the proportion of women is below 30% of the leadership positions (i.e., management committee), possible actions to promote gender diversity will be discussed and included in the ESG action plan. Furthermore, a code of conduct will be signed, including non-discrimination in hiring, the fight against sexual harassment but also equal pay for the same job.
- With regard to climate change effects, working conditions to be adapted to climate change effect, such as high temperature. Prevention and measures to be set up against natural disasters.

#### For clients:
- Prospective investees shall be excluded from IPAE 3's list of prohibited sectors and undertake not to develop any form of activity in these sectors.
- Goods and services provided shall not have significant adverse effects on human health or well-being. To ensure client protection, prospective investees shall commit to implementing adequate quality systems and to providing accessible and transparent information on goods and services.
- With respect to microfinance, endorsement of the Smart Campaign and gradual implementation of the Client Protection Principles will be required.

#### For other stakeholders:
- Prospective investees shall ensure fair business practices will all subcontractors.
- When investment projects may affect local communities, social and environmental external impact assessments will be required, including a consultation process of affected communities.
- If the investment project is likely to result in significant and adverse effects on the environment or human populations the entrepreneur should demonstrate its capacity to implement a management system reducing these negative effects to an acceptable level.

#### Governance:
- Shareholders shall commit to implementing formal governance bodies that meet regularly and ensure shared decision-making processes.
- Prospective investees shall commit to implementing reliable and transparent accounting & auditing systems, in compliance with fiscal laws.

For all investment projects likely to have significant risk of corruption or other issues related to business integrity, prospective investees shall demonstrate integrity and high ethical standards and commit to establishing appropriate policies and control procedures.

#### Climate
➔ Customized and formalized action plan to enhance the investee's climate change adaptation
➔ Along with an annual carbon footprint report

#### Gender
➔ Code of conduct set up, including non-discrimination in hiring, fight against sexual harassment, equal pay
➔ Specific TA for gender lens on stakeholders

### EXIT

I&P selects buyers who will allow for the sustainability of the company's impacts and ensure good ESG practices. These topics are integrated into the discussions with the buyer.

These topics are integrated from the start into the discussions with potential buyers.

Potential buyers are required to present an ESG strategy in their offer, and this will be considered into the scoring.

#### Climate
➔ Potential buyers are required to present an environment and climate strategy in their offer

### Impact Management System

#### Pre-investment impact assessment

I&P has set up a specific methodology to evaluate the impacts. The I&P team has developed an Impact Screening Scorecard for assessing potential impact of any investment project on its key stakeholders. The scorecard consists of a questionnaire structured around the core areas of IPAE's impact investing thesis:

- Impact on African entrepreneurship
- Impact on employees (both quantitative and qualitative);
- Impact on clients;
- Impact on local suppliers & distributors;
- Impact on gender empowerment
- Impact on the environment.

#### Post-investment impact assessment

I&P has implemented its own Impact Assessment monitoring system, which includes IRIS metrics among others. The I&P team collects and analyses close to one hundred indicators every year, classified into the following categories:

- Impact on employees with a focus on decent work criteria and Sustainable Development Goals 5 and 8 targets: creation of formal jobs, job patterns (gender, wages, etc.), employee training and benefits, etc. The contribution to new SDGs with the goods and services provided is assessed sector by sector (SDG 1, 2, 3 4 6, 7, 9 and 11) with company specific metrics (ex: number of new born babies for maternities, number of borrowers/savers for microfinance institutions, etc.).
- Impact on clients: number of clients, number of borrowers/savers for microfinance institutions;
- Impact on local supplierss & distributors: number and share of local suppliers/distributors;
- Impact on national value added: contribution to state revenues, GDP, and exports;
- Impact on investees and entrepreneurs: assessment of progress made by partner companies on business practices (marketing, operations & quality, finance, ESG, etc.).

In addition, I&P occasionally conducts in-depth impact case studies in some portfolio companies to complement these portfolio-wide generic indicators. A team of I&P's research officers and three to four trained students from non-profit organizations carries out a one-month field survey among local investee stakeholders to evaluate the company's impacts. Impact case studies provide partner companies with practical recommendations. As an active partner of the company, the investment team ensures proper follow-up of these recommendations, including at the board level. Eight case studies have been completed to date.

### Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)

In addition to I&P's own analysis and data collection framework, IPAE 3 will try to integrate the PAI (Principal Adverse Impact) indicators related to SFDR and is exploring being considered as "act as" article 9, although the legal domicile in Mauritius makes the fund not directly concerned by this regulation.

## 3.8.3 IPAE 3 impact thesis

IPAE3 ambition is to promote local entrepreneurship to foster inclusive growth and stability in West Africa and Indian Ocean least developed countries.

Specifically, the main impact objectives pursued at the fund levels are:
- Developing local entrepreneurship to foster inclusive growth and stability in West Africa and Indian Ocean, especially in least developed countries.
- Creating decent jobs that allow people to live with dignity, and strengthening access to health insurance and safety at work
- Strengthen the resilience of the African continent by promoting self-reliance through local production and by meeting essential goods and services related to the SDGs
- Supporting women empowerment within the different stakeholders and layers of the company
- Fighting against climate change by supporting environmentally-friendly development

IPAE 3 will have a strengthened gender, environmental and climate strategy. Specific objectives are set on these two focuses.

### Gender strategy

Our gender focus has enabled us to generate powerful impacts for the benefit of African women. Entrepreneurship is an important dimension of our strategy, with 32% of women entrepreneurs in the IPAE2 fund (compared to 19% for the IPAE1 fund). Nearly 76% of the companies supported by IPAE 2 are considered gender friendly as per the 2X Challenge criteria.

IPAE3 will capitalize on the good performance already achieved and seek to further develop its investment strategy with a gender perspective, both quantitatively and qualitatively by further integrating gender-related practices.

A first objective will be directly anchored in the impact carried (more details are given below on the impact carried)
- 100% of the companies will be gender-friendly according to the 2X Challenge criteria, which takes into account gender in leadership, employment and among beneficiaries.

Other targets not linked to the impact carried will also be set as part of this gender strategy and will be monitored and reported on by the team
- At least 30% of women entrepreneurs, to maintain the good performance of the previous fund. Indeed, women entrepreneurs remain critically underrepresented: in 2019, only 8% of deals over USD 1 million have been disbursed to a woman entrepreneur in Africa
- In each company, a code of conduct will be signed, including non-discrimination in hiring, the fight against sexual harassment but also equal pay for the same job.

The ESG and Impact tool will be updated to strengthen the gender analysis at each stage of the investment process and on the different stakeholders, especially in the upstream value chain or among the beneficiaries of the products and services developed by the company.

IPAE team and entrepreneurs will be sensitized on taking gender into account among the various stakeholders and unconscious bias.

### Environmental and climate strategy

IPAE 3 finances and supports African SMEs facing physical risks (rising temperatures, increased frequency of natural disasters, etc.) and transitional risks (regulatory risks, devaluation of assets, changes in behaviour due to climate change) that can have a number of impacts, such as disruption of supply chains, reduced profitability and changes to business models.

The subject of climate change has become crucial over the years: fifteen years ago, I&P began the IPAE adventure without a dedicated climate thesis. At the time, we had obtained environmental impact results, which we decided to enhance by formulating specific climate objectives for IPAE2. Today, IPAE3's climate thesis is at the heart of the impact strategy.

Its common thread takes the form of a triple diagnosis on our past and present portfolio:
- a strong percentage of our SMEs either have direct adaptation or mitigation related products, services or activities as part of their business model;
- all of investees need to adapt themselves and their stakeholders to the effect of the climate change and IPAE, as a shareholder, has a role to play in that approach;
- our investees can and need to include a reduction of CO2 emission strategy in their development and IPAE can play a key role to support them in this ambition

As a consequence, IPAE 3 aims to support SMEs in their efforts to build their resilience as they:
- For 60% of the portfolio: will offer solutions for adapting to or mitigating climate change to their clients or suppliers,
- For 100% of the portfolio: will be supported in adaptation and mitigation strategies both for themselves and their stakeholders through specific Due Diligence processes and ESG action plan
- Will decorrelate their economic growth and the raise of their CO2 emissions.

These 3 dimensions are described below in more detail.

Before getting into the said details, it is important to note that beyond the climate topic, there is an additional need to conceive an exemplary broader environmental policy. This policy will include: reducing natural resources use, waste and effluent emissions, the use of plastics, deforestation and encouraging the protection of biodiversity. Within this policy, a thorough review will take place for all sectors linked to the pollution and the degradation of ecosystems, and activities that damage the continent's capacity to adapt, possibly leading to exclusion.

#### 1/ IPAE3 supports SMEs that develop climate-friendly products and services and have mitigating and adapting business models

Based on the meaning that adaptation activities refer to any entrepreneurial project that (i) reduces external dependency and builds a local market for local customers (ii) enhances food security, (iii) reduces exposure to and intensity of climate risks (iv) reduces energy intensity and moves towards sustainability (v) conserves and promotes biodiversity and improves land efficiency (vi) saves natural resources, we can say that: 60% of the companies supported by IPAE3 will offer a service and/or product relating to the climate change adaptation or mitigation options proposed by the IPCC (areas: energy supply; land, water, food; settlements and infrastructure; health; society, livelihood and economy). This service and/or product, if not yet part of the company's offering at the time of IPAE3's investment, will be developed during the course of the fund's investment, under the impetus of IPAE3.

This first objective will be directly anchored in the impact carried (more details are given below on the impact carried)

#### 2/ IPAE3 helps SMEs and their stakeholders adapt to the effects of climate change

In addition to supporting companies that develop climate-friendly products and services, IPAE 3 will support their own adaptation to climate change on three levels, maximising the investment's impact: at the level of the companies invested, at the stakeholders' level, and at the fund's level.

##### Investees
- A systematic climate risk and adaptation evaluation to enable companies to identify the areas of concern in terms of adaptation.
- A tailored and formalized action plan to strengthen the investee's adaptation to climate change, these actions being specific to the sector but actions common to all companies such as:
  - Protection and optimisation of resources (particularly water)
  - Integrating adaptation considerations into procurement procedures
  - Setting up a function responsible for environmental and climate issues, where appropriate
  - Energy efficiency and reliability
- Taking out insurance to cover identified risks. Climate-related issues will be systematically reviewed at company board meetings.

##### Stakeholders
- Employees will be systematically made aware of, and trained in, the effects of climate change, in particular how to react to meteorological hazards and natural disasters.
- Working conditions will have to be consistent with the known or expected impacts of climate change, particularly rising temperatures.
- Suppliers will be selected on the basis of their vulnerability to climate change, and will be encouraged to raise awareness among their suppliers.
- At local community level, the investee will have to engage and take into account feedback from local communities.

##### The fund
➔ An investment process that takes climate issues into account, from screening to exit
➔ A team that is aware of and trained in environmental and climate issues
➔ Governance that addresses environmental and climate issues
➔ A team incentive scheme based in particular on the achievement of climate objectives (impact carried)
➔ A specific toolbox adapted to the strategy (ESG and impact monitoring tool, environmental Scorecard for mitigation and adaptation, technical assistance, etc.)

#### 3/ Decorrelation of economic growth and CO2 emissions

IPAE 3 aims at decarbonizing its portfolio by significantly decoupling revenue growth and CO2 emissions growth. This means that each unit of production achieved requires proportionally less pollution at the end of the investment.

We consider that a decorrelation would be significant from 15%. In other words, if the turnover of companies doubles and thus increases by 100%, CO2 emissions should increase by less than 85% at most. This will be carried out through various initiatives such as energy audits for the most energy-intensive companies and integration of an ESG action plan.

And finally, IPAE 3 will support the TCFD recommendations to build a more resilient financial system through climate-related disclosure.

## 3.8.4 Portfolio level impact targets

IPAE 3 will seek to maximize impacts through proactive management of the portfolio based on measurable impact targets aggregated at the portfolio level. The Fund's final impact performance will be assessed against a set of key impact targets, which would be fully achieved in a best-case scenario.

The proposed impact targets set for IPAE 3 are detailed below:

- Developing local entrepreneurship to foster inclusive growth and stability in West Africa and Indian Ocean, especially in least developed countries.
  - Key impact target 1: Percentage of companies owned or led by leaders rooted in Africa on the long term (target: 80% or more)
  - As a benchmark, 82% of IPAE2 entrepreneurs are rooted in Africa, which has always been a key feature of IPAE funds. Comparatively, Village Capital found that 90% of the capital invested in East Africa went to expatriate-founded businesses

- Creating decent jobs that allow people to live with dignity, and strengthening access to health insurance and safety at work
  - Key impact target 2: Percentage of direct employment growth during the holding period and aggregated at the portfolio level (target: 30% or more)
  - Key impact target 3: Percentage of companies that has improved health and safety in the workplace or social protection for employees during the holding period (target: 70% or more)
  - As a benchmark, Norfund (the Norwegian Investment Fund for developing countries) has seen employment growth of 3% in 2022, which would correspond to employment growth of 16% over 5 years. As another example, the Mirova IED fund (Dynamic Employment Integration) has grown by 18.4% over 5 years between 2014 and 2019. This performance seems to be quite stable over time as IFC has shown an 18% growth in employment between 2000 and 2010 on IFC funded projects

Definition: Improvement of health and safety in the workplace or social protection for employees include:
- Significant actions improving the management of one or more of the following situations for employees and/or their families: old-age, sickness, disability or death, unemployment, maternity, primary family care responsibilities.
- Implementation or upgrade of health and safety procedures or other improvements going beyond compliance with IFC standards.

- Strengthen the resilience of the African continent by promoting self-reliance through local production and by meeting essential goods and services related to the SDGs
  - Key impact target 4: Percentage of companies improving the resilience of the African continent (target: 80% or more)
  - A company is considered to be building African resilience if it meets at least one of the following criteria: it produces essential goods and services that meet the SDGs or it promotes import substitution.
  - As a benchmark, 82% of IPAE2 companies directly contributes to the SDGs, a very high performance that we want to replicate.

- Supporting women empowerment within the different stakeholders and layers of the company
  - Key impact target 5: Percentage of companies that are defined as a gender-lens investment according to the 2X Challenge criteria. (Target: 100%)
  - The 2X Challenge was launched in 2018 as a new commitment of the development finance institutions (DFIs) from the G7 countries to unlock resources that will help advance women's economic empowerment and gender equality. To qualify for the 2X Challenge, an investment must meet at least one of the following criteria: the business is founded by a woman; at least 20-30% of women in senior management depending on the sector; at least 30-50% women employee depending on the sector; produce a good or service specifically or disproportionately benefit women. More details can be found on their website: https://www.2xchallenge.org/criteria
  - As a benchmark, 82% of IPAE2 portfolio companies satisfy the 2X challenge criteria, a performance that was already improving compared to IPAE1 (76%). In comparison, Phatisa with its Food Fund 2 is committed to channel 30% of its investments to 2X eligible companies. Adenia Partners is committed to have 50-75% of future funds' companies align with at least one 2X Challenge criteria.

- Fighting against climate change by supporting environmentally-friendly development
  - Key impact target 6: Percentage of companies that directly offer solutions for adapting to or mitigating climate change to their clients or their suppliers as defined by IPCC. (Target: 60%)
  - Based on the meaning that adaptation activities refer to any entrepreneurial project that (i) reduces external dependency and builds a local market for local customers (ii) enhances food security, (iii) reduces exposure to and intensity of climate risks (iv) reduces energy intensity and moves towards sustainability (v) conserves and promotes biodiversity and improves land efficiency (vi) saves natural resources, we could expect that: 60% of the companies supported by IPAE3 will offer a service and/or product relating to the climate change adaptation or mitigation options proposed by the IPCC (areas: energy supply; land, water, food; settlements and infrastructure; health; society, livelihood and economy). This service and/or product, if not yet part of the company's offering at the time of IPAE3's investment, will be developed during the course of the fund's investment, under the impetus of IPAE3.
  - IPAE1 & 2 companies that are directly offering solutions for adapting to or mitigating climate change represent 41% of the portfolio. 9% more could have been accompanied by I&P in order to design new offers for adapting to or mitigating climate change.

The Advisory Committee will be left with a certain degree of flexibility to adjust the system if necessary and when setting the final carried interest percentage.

Annual impact metrics will be collected on the overall portfolio to monitor these key impact figures (among others). To ensure impact data reliability, these key impact figures will be audited two or three times in the fund's life. This audit will be conducted by an independent company. The selection of the auditor, as well as the precise scope and timing of these audits will be set together with the Advisory Committee after the fund's inception.

## 3.8.5 Implementing an Impact-based incentive structure

IPAE 3 will include a carried interest mechanism described in details in this sub-section and Section 3.11 below. Its main features are a hurdle rate of 5% and a distribution of 10%, consistent with the impact positioning of the fund.

It is proposed that the Key impact targets (described in section 0) act on two dimensions of the financial terms and incentive structuration for the Investment Manager, namely on the level of the hurdle rate and on the carried-interest rate.

- Key Impact target 5 and 6 would impact the level of hurdle rate and if achieved, could reduce the level of hurdle by 0.5% each. Key Impact target 5 to the objective that 100% of the portfolio companies meet the 2X Challenge criteria and Key Impact target 6 relates to the objective that 60% of companies will directly offer solutions for adapting to or mitigating climate change to their clients or their suppliers (as defined by IPCC). Target SMEs for IPAE 3 portfolio will be assessed against all Key Impact targets and their capacity to achieve all or most of them. Some of these Key Impact targets will particularly influence and narrow the scope of target SMEs, this is the case of Key Impacts targets 5 and 6 and the reason why it is proposed that these two Impact targets may allow for a decreased hurdle rate. It is also the case of Key Impact target 1 but this objective is somehow more "usual" to I&P as it has been part of I&P DNA since its inception, hence less specific to IPAE 3, but this is not to say that this Key Impact target 1 will be an easy objective and low-hanging fruit for IPAE 3.

- Key impact targets 1, 2, 3 and 4 would impact the level of the carried interest and, if achieved, would generate extra-carry percentages, in addition to the baseline carried-interest percentage set at 10%, by 1% each.

The proposed mechanism is inspired by the impact-based mechanism already implemented for IPAE 2 with some evolution. The rationale of the proposed innovative impact carried-interest mechanism to reflect and take into account, in the assessment of the financial and impact performance of the fund, the specificities of IPAE 3 investment and impact strategy, with core additionality objectives and dedicated to SMEs in the missing middle largely orientated towards countries that are classified as Least Developed Countries or Fragile Countries, where the macro economical, geo-political, security, sanitary climate is highly challenging and enhance the incentive of the team to the extent to which impact targets are met (or not).

The mechanism and its integration in the distribution waterfall of IPAE 3 is further detailed in section 3.11.

### Establishment of extra-financial governance

#### Investment Advisory Committee

The Investment Advisory Committee would include an Impact & ESG specialist who challenges investment projects on ESG and impact issues. Whenever an investment project raises compliance issues regarding ESG standards, the investment team should seek specific guidance from the committee member dedicated to ESG & Impact issues. Outcomes from these discussions and proposals to manage the situation shall be reflected in the memorandum and discussed with the Committee prior to a final decision.

#### ESG & Impact Committee

An ESG & Impact Committee composed of 4 to 5 independent members was set up to provide guidance to the Investment Manager I&P. It has a consultative role. It meets twice a year and submits proposals to the Board with regard to: (i) ESG & impact strategy and management system (ii) the Fund's impact-based incentive structure (iii) annual assessment of the Fund's extra-financial performance and review of the annual report (iv) selection of a company to audit impact figures every two years (v) and, on a case-by-case basis, guidance on ESG standards implementation for partner companies.

#### Advisory Committee

With respect to ESG, the Advisory Committee's main roles will include: (i) review of the Fund's ESG & impact management system (ii) validation of the Fund's key impact targets, as a basis for the impact-based incentive structure for the Fund manager (iii) and validation of the extra-financial auditor.
